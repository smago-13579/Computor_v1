# Computor_v1
Summary: This project is the first in a series that aims to make you rekindle with
maths. They will be quite useful - not to say essential - for numerous projects to come.

Write a program that solves a polynomial second or lower degree equation.

That being said, you obviously cannot use a math lib function (except for subtrac-
tion, division, addition and multiplication of real numbers) that you would not have
implemented yourself.
